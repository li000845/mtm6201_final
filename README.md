 # Reflections on the UI to Web Development Process

Turning UI design into an actual website has **never been an easy task** for me. Compared to the pursuit of aesthetics during the visual design phase, there's a significant difference when it comes to turning it into a usable website.

- For example, many designs are too idealistic and simply **cannot be perfectly implemented** during coding.
- It might also be due to my lack of skills, but I feel that this aspect has caused me the most trouble.

## The Process

As for the process, I usually:

1. **Start by completing the HTML**
2. **Add CSS** to beautify the webpage.

However, I've encountered numerous instances where poor code quality led to unnecessary effort, which was a huge waste of time. I believe this also reflects my lack of skills, and I **still need much more practice**.

## Designing UI Interfaces

Through this project, I've realized that when designing UI interfaces:

- I rely more on **imagination based on research** to create a website that users will like. This approach is more intuitive.
- However, when I turn my designs into an actual website, I think from a **rational perspective**, considering things like how much margin is needed, whether calculations are necessary, and so on.

## Reflections and Future

I find this very interesting. Although the outcome isn't the best, there's still a **vast space for improvement**. But through this project, I've subtly developed the illusion of already becoming a UX designer, and I've grown more interested in it. Despite the numerous difficulties encountered along the way, I believe it's just a **solid beginning**.

# Resources

In this project, I utilized a variety of resources and tools for designing UI interfaces and converting them into a functional website. Below is a list of some particularly helpful resources:

## Design Tools

- [Figma](https://www.figma.com) - My primary interface design tool used for creating UI designs.

## Figma Plugins

During the design process, I used the following Figma plugins, which greatly improved my workflow efficiency:

- **Icons8** - A highly useful plugin for utilizing images and icons. [Icons8 Plugin for Figma](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/791103617505812222)

## Google Fonts

- [Open Sans on Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans?query=Open) - Utilized for typography in the project design.
